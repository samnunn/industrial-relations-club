        # What It Does
        1. Takes the user-entered shift information from the DOM (createModelFromUserEnteredShifts)
        2. Breaks the shifts into chunks of sixty minutes or less (breakShiftIntoChunks)
        3. Uses the start time of each chunk to work out what rate it should be paid at (calculatePayRateForChunk)
        4. Aggregates applicable pay rates and how much time was worked at each rate
        5. Multiplies rates x time worked to calculate how much money is owed
        
        # Rounding Behaviour
        - HSS rounds to the nearest cent after the total amount owed **in each penalty rate** is calculated
        - It's not per-shift or per-payslip
        - Although our payslips report an hourly rate of $40.07 for an intern, it's actually 83609 / (52.1666 * 40) = $40.06826207 that gets used in pay calculations
        - The placement of every .toFixed() in this code is deliberate, so be mindful when making changes
